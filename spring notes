What is Spring
===============
The act of wiring beans together is based on a pattern known as dependency injection
(DI). Rather than have components create and maintain the lifecycle of other beans
that they depend on, a dependency-injected application relies on a separate entity
(the container) to create and maintain all components and inject those into the beans
that need them. This is done typically through constructor arguments or property
accessor methods
